Docket
- Super slow to find game
- Question doesn't disappear
- Allow player to hit enter to end question if they don't know the answer.
Edge
- Create a cascade delete to erase models from database (could be built in sql)
- Clickable game ids that allow the user to replay particular games and holds game records of previous plays for game

Up for debate
- If game doesn't finish don't save
